# Neo4j-GraphRAG

To enable users to perform complex graph-based reasoning and querying tasks without requiring prior knowledge of Cypher or Neo4j, we can use the capabilities of Langchain to integrate large language models (LLMs) into a workflow designed to generate and execute Cypher queries in a Neo4j graph database. By combining modules such as Langchain.graphs, Langchain.prompts, PromptTemplate, and Langchain OpenAI, (figure)  the system facilitates a seamless interaction between natural language queries and graph-based reasoning.
